    info:
      "Pricer Co. was founded in 2009 in Matsuyama City, Ehime Prefecture, Japan. We had a wonderful encounter in Japan and we were able to establish Pricer Bishkek in the Kyrgyz Republic. Pricer Bishkek is mainly engaged in the development of mobile applications (IOS, Android). We aim to contribute to the social and economic development of Kyrgyzstan, and make peoples' lives more convenient. Our strengths are the technological capabilities and expertise that we have built-in Japan. We carry out all processes from planning and design to operation. We will continue to create even better services by combining the 'Commitment' of our customers and staff."
